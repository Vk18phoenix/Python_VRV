# Python_VRV

***PROJECT OVERVIEW****: In my project, I developed a Python script that analyzes web server log files to gather insights about user requests, identify the most accessed endpoints, and detect suspicious activities like failed login attempts. This script is useful for understanding traffic patterns and enhancing security by identifying potential threats.
***FILE SAVED***: I save the 2 files in python project folder one is Python code with py extension and another one is sample.log file as the input data you given. 
***RUN CODE***: I didn't used flask or any library, just used the command prompt for run the code and print the output.
***OUTPUT***: The script will print the analysis results in the terminal, includes,
a)Requests per IP address.
b)The most frequently accessed endpoint.
c)Any suspicious activity detected.
***OUTPUT FILE***: the results will be saved in CSV file named "log_analysis_results.csv" as you've mentioned.
